This is a Django application. Run using any trunk version of Django
(circa October, 2010).

The DB and template settings are self-set (using `os.getcwd()`), and an
sqllit3 database file will be created right inside the /tictactoe/
directory (for ease of installation).

To install, simply CD into the /tictactoe/ directory and run
`python manage.py syncdb`, then `python manage.py runserver 8080`.

You can now play at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
